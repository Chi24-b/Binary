I implemented functions with parameters in Week 4 to organize displaying the menu and modifying the task list. On my second prompt, I added loops and list commands from Week 5 so users could take part in tasks more than once and the program would record and access completed tasks. To enhance input safety, I started using the basic try/except approach for input validation that was covered in Week 10, so now the program is less likely to fail. In the third prompt, I used file handling skills established in Week 7 so my tasks could keep running with open() and readlines(). As I refined the course, I made sure to stay within its limits and boosted the user experience and app reliability by demonstrating how to program in a beginner’s way."

        "* Both validate input using simple if checks\n",

        "**Two Differences**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Exception handling specificity\n",
        "\n",
        "The refined version uses a single general except: block with a basic print message. This is appropriate for Week 8, where we only use simple try/except.\n",
        "The ideal version uses specific exception types like KeyError, IndexError, and separates data access errors from connection errors. This technique goes beyond Week 8 and reflects more advanced control over error feedback.\n",

        "2. Function structure complexity\n",

        "The refined version handles everything in a single block, which is easier to read for beginners. This matches Week 8’s lab format, where clarity and simplicity are prioritized.\n",
        "The ideal version separates the API call and JSON access into nested try/except blocks, improving modularity. While this improves error tracing, it's not required at the Week 8 level and introduces more complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**One Course Concept Demonstrated**\n",
        "\n",
        "Basic Exception Handling (Week 8):\n",
        "The refined version follows Week 8’s lesson by wrapping risky API operations in a try/except block and using simple `print()` statements to notify the user. This is a key strategy from the Week 8 labs on handling unreliable data from external APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**One Improvement After Reading Chapter 6**\n",
        "\n",
        "After reviewing Textbook Chapter 6, which discusses clarity of error reporting, I would improve the refined version by making the error message more specific. Instead of one general `\"Error: Could not extract weather data\"`, I would consider splitting it into clearer stages like:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `\"Error: Could not connect to weather service\"`\n",
        "* `\"Error: Data format unexpected\"`\n",
